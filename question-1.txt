1. Normal distribution of the likelihood p(x|i) and pooled covariance matrix (for all classes)
2. Normal distribution of the likelihood p(x|i)
3. Metric for defining "nearest"
4. CART does not require any assumptions for underlying distributions, requires choice of partitioning of data, usually in groups of 10
